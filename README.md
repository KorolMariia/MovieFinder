# Movies Search  ReactJS
[Demo](https://searchmovies-opal.vercel.app/)

This app was developed using the TMDB API, providing users with the following features:
* Search for movies using a search bar
* Filter movies by genre and language
* Read detailed descriptions of each movie
* Add or remove movies from a personalized "Favorites" list

The registration page showcases validation functionality to ensure accuracy and security.
To access the site, users must log in through a login page.


To start the app do (development):
* *npm install*
* *npm start*

I used:
* ReactJS: functional components and hooks
* Reduxjs/toolkit
* React-routers
* React-hook-form for validation form
* SASS
* TMDB API
* Axios
* Redux-thunk
* Redux-logger
* Material-UI
* Versel for Demo
