# MovieFinder
[Demo](https://searchmovies-opal.vercel.app/)

This app was developed using the TMDB API, providing users with the following features:

- Search for movies using a search bar
- Filter movies by genre and language
- Read detailed descriptions of each movie
- Add or remove movies from a personalized "Favorites" list

The registration page showcases validation functionality to ensure accuracy and security.
To access the site, users must log in through a login page.

## This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

I used:

- ReactJS: functional components and hooks
- Reduxjs/toolkit
- React-routers
- React-hook-form for validation form
- SASS
- TMDB API
- Axios
- Redux-thunk
- Redux-logger
- Material-UI
- Versel for Demo

#### To start the app do (development):

Firstly, you must add the file **.env** with your Github API access key.

> Note: You can generate it in https://www.themoviedb.org/

You can see the file **.env-sample** - a sample of what it should look.

```sh
